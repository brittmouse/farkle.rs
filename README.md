This is going to be a farkle game written in Rust and played in the console.

It is incredibly barebones at the moment but I do plan on getting the scoring system working soon.

Ideally I want this to become a GUI game that you can play with multiple people. I'm not sure whether that will be in person or over a network yet but I do want it to become that.
